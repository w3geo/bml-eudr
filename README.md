## AMA Client certificate

To convert the AMA client certificate to .crt and .key files for use with Node HTTPS Agent's `cert` and `key` properties, use the following:

    openssl pkcs12 -in BML-Partner.pfx -nocerts -out temp.key
    openssl rsa -in temp.key -out ama-partner.key # remove passphrase
    openssl pkcs12 -in BML-Partner.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out ama-partner.crt

`temp.key` can be deleted. `ama-partner.crt` is used for the agent's `cert`, `ama-partner.key` for the agent's `key`.
